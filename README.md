Based on the audio input, the center figure changes its shape. It also adapts to verbal commands: "bigger" and "smaller." The demo is available [here](https://bit.ly/prototype_jacob), preferably on Chrome. In order to view it, you can take the following steps: 

* Search “chrome://flags/“ in the address bar
* Search “Autoplay Policy”
* Set it to “No user gesture is required.”
* Search "Experimental Extension APIs"
* Set it to "Enabled"
* Relaunch Chrome
* After viewing it, set the settings back to their previous conditions.

MICROPHONE ACCESS IS REQUIRED.
